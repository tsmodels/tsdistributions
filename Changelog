	* DESCRIPTION (Version): version is 0.2.0
	* Fix to snorm distribution (dsnorm) for cases when variable z == 0. Other skewed 
	distributions used signum function but this distribution seems to have
	missed the 0 case for some reason.
	* Added vcov methods and other sandwich estimators (QMLE, OP, NW).
	* Added BIC and AIC and created a print method for the summary.
	* Fixed some code fomatting issues
